# Jansen_Mechanism_simulation
 
This repository has the MATLAB code for the Jansen Mechanism simulation. When run, `kinematic_simulation` displays a gif of the movement of the Jansen mechanism over one revolution, and creates the file `node6data` containing the data for the trajectory of node 6. `num_diff` contains the implementations of the numerical differentiation velocity analysis, and when run creates graphs of the speed of node 6 along with the velocity in the X and Y directions. 

Further work can be done in this project, particularly in modifying the simulation file to store the data of all nodes and angles as opposed to just node 6, and expanding the numerical differentiation file to conduct velocity and acceleration analysis of all nodes and angles. This data can then be used to conduct a dynamic force analysis, which will give more accurate values than what was calculated by hand in the project's final submission.
